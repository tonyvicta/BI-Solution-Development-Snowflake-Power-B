# Project Scope:
As a Freelance BI Developer, this project aims to design and develop a Business Intelligence (BI) solution that integrates data from various sources into Snowflake, performs ETL operations, and provides insights via Power BI dashboards to support data-driven decision-making.


# üìå Step 1: Business Requirements

Identify data sources (CSV files)

Understand key business questions (e.g., revenue trends, customer segmentation).

Define KPIs and metrics for reports and dashboards.

Document requirements in the docs/ folder.


# üìå Step 2: Set Up Snowflake Warehouse

Create a Snowflake Account (if not already available).

Set Up Database & Schemas:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE BI_ANALYTICS;
CREATE SCHEMA RAW;
CREATE SCHEMA STAGING;
CREATE SCHEMA ANALYTICS;
```

# üìå Step 3: Set Up Load CSV Data into Snowflake 

Step 3.1: Prepare the CSV Files
Ensure the CSV files (customers_data.csv and transactions_data.csv) are available on your local machine.
Check that they are formatted correctly (comma-separated, proper headers, and clean data).

Step 3.2: Manually Upload CSV Files to Snowflake
To load the CSV files into Snowflake manually, follow these steps:

1Ô∏è‚É£ Log into Snowflake
Open your web browser and log in to your Snowflake account.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a Table to Store Data
Before uploading, create tables in Snowflake to store the CSV data.


For Custoemrs Data 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE STAGING.CUSTOMERS (
    Customer_ID INT,
    Name STRING,
    Country STRING,
    Spend INT,
    Segment STRING
);
```

For Transactons Data: 

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE STAGING.TRANSACTIONS (
    Transaction_ID INT,
    Customer_ID INT,
    Date DATE,
    Product_Category STRING,
    Amount INT
);
```

3Ô∏è‚É£ Upload the CSV Files Manually

Step 3.3: Verify Data Load
Once the data is uploaded, validate it with SQL queries.

1. Check Record Count:

```sql

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STAGING.CUSTOMERS;
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM STAGING.TRANSACTIONS;

```

2. Preview Data:

```sql
SELECT * FROM STAGING.CUSTOMERS LIMIT 10;
SELECT * FROM STAGING.TRANSACTIONS LIMIT 10;

```

Step 3.4: Automate Data Refresh

Since the files are uploaded manually, Set up a Snowflake Task to refresh the data at regular intervals.

Schedule a refresh task every hour:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TASK REFRESH_CUSTOMERS
WAREHOUSE = COMPUTE_WH
SCHEDULE = '1 HOUR'
AS
DELETE FROM STAGING.CUSTOMERS;
```

üìå Step 4: Transform & Optimize Data in Snowflake
Before visualizing data, clean, standardize, and optimize it for analytics.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Create Analytical Tables (Fact & Dimension Models)
Create fact and dimension tables to improve query performance and support Power BI reporting.

Create a Dimension Table for Customers

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ANALYTICS.DIM_CUSTOMERS AS
SELECT 
    Customer_ID, 
    Name, 
    Country, 
    Segment
FROM STAGING.CUSTOMERS;
```

Create a Fact Table for Transactions

```sql

CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS AS
SELECT 
    T.Transaction_ID,
    T.Customer_ID,
    C.Country,
    C.Segment,
    T.Date,
    T.Product_Category,
    T.Amount
FROM STAGING.TRANSACTIONS T
LEFT JOIN STAGING.CUSTOMERS C
ON T.Customer_ID = C.Customer_ID;

```

2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimize Query Performance in Snowflake
Since Power BI will be querying the data frequently, we optimize performance by:

Creating Clustering Keys

```sql
ALTER TABLE ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS
CLUSTER BY (Date, Product_Category);
```

Using Materialized Views for Aggregated Reports

```sql
CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW ANALYTICS.MONTHLY_SALES AS
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('month', Date) AS Month,
    Product_Category,
    SUM(Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY 1, 2;
```


üìå Step 5: Perform Business Analysis Using SQL Queries
Now that the data is structured properly, let's run business queries to generate insights.

1Ô∏è‚É£ Total Sales by Month

SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', Date) AS Month, 
       SUM(Amount) AS Total_Sales
FROM ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;

2Ô∏è‚É£ Top 5 Countries by Revenue

```sql
SELECT Country, 
       SUM(Amount) AS Revenue
FROM ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY Country
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

```
3Ô∏è‚É£ Customer Segmentation Analysis

```sql

SELECT Segment, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT Customer_ID) AS Customer_Count, 
       SUM(Amount) AS Total_Spend
FROM ANALYTICS.FACT_TRANSACTIONS
GROUP BY Segment
ORDER BY Total_Spend DESC;

```

These queries can be used to validate data before connecting to Power BI.


üìå Step 6: Connect Power BI to Snowflake

Now, connect Power BI to Snowflake to build interactive dashboards.
